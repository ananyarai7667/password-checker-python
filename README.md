Mini project
Create a Password Strength Indicator for a login page of our website

Provide a visual indicator showing the strength of the password (e.g., weak, medium, strong).
Consider factors like length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.
Hint: If password length is >8 it is strong, greater than 6 and less than 8 is medium, less than 5 is weak
